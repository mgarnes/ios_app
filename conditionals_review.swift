/* Review from Codecademy
 * An if statement consists of a condition and code block that executes when the condition is true.
 * An else statement is immediately followed by a code block that executes when all previous conditions were false.
 * A code block is denoted by a set of curly braces {}.
 * Multiple else if statements can be chained within an if/else to provide additional conditions.
 * Comparison operators include <, >, <=, >=, ==, and != and are used to compare the values of two operands.
 * A switch statement looks for the value of a case that matches the value of an expression.
 * A switch statement can have cases that contain multiple items known as compound cases.
 * A switch statementâ€™s case can include a range of values using the closed range operator (...).
