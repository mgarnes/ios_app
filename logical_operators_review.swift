/* Review from Codecademy
 * The logical && operator translates to AND and returns true only when both operands are true. It returns false in all other cases.
 * The logical || operator translates to OR and returns true when either operands are true. When both operands are false, the logical expression evaluates to false.
 * The logical ! operator translates to NOT and negates a Boolean value.
 * The && operator has a higher precedence over the || operator.
 * Parentheses, (), may be used in a logical expression to control the order of operations and improve readability.
